Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09405

Original Repo: https://github.com/deepmind/deepmind-research/tree/master/learning_to_simulate

Inital Pytorch Version: https://github.com/wu375/simple-physics-simulator-pytorch-geometry

# Current issues
- tfrecord dataloader is not working: tensorflow still needed for dataset
  

# Example
Example result of wu375 after 425k steps of training:
